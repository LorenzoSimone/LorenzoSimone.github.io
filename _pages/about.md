I received a MSc Degree in Artificial Intelligence (cum laude) from the University of Pisa, supervised by [Prof. Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/) with a thesis on a novel self-supervised generative adversarial framework ECGAN for electrocardiography.  
I am currently a Reserch Fellow at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/) applying NLP to health-related tasks.  
My research interests include deep generative models exploiting compressed and sparse representations for sequential and structured data, as well as neural networks and reservoir computing.
